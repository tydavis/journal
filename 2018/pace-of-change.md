# The Pace of Change

>Published 2018-07-17

One of the first subjects my law professor discussed with the class is the
nature of change. We, as a society, expect ever faster change in our world
through additions like cars, cell phones, the internet, and ever continuing
development of purpose and meaning around those things: privacy laws, seat-belt
laws, regulation and testing, etc.  This leads to the "[superstructure][4]"
changing faster than the infrastructure.

The problem with this ever-faster pace of evolution is that the law, our norms,
and our generational preferences are part of the *infrastrucutre*. While
technology is unmoored from the limits of certain things like social convention,
we still have people who will physically assault someone for wearing [Google
Glass][1] or recording them via phone. While this may have been an issue as
early as 2008/2009, we [have states establishing two-party consent][3]
requirements as early as 2010, and by 2017 we have a [constitutional rights to
record police][2]. It took ten *years* for the law to catch up to the
proliferation of portable, high-quality recording devices, and even then our
societal norms haven't caught up.
